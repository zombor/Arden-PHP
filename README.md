# Arden-PHP

Arden is a repository pattern library for php. It is a counterpart for [Arden](https://github.com/zombor/arden), which is a repository pattern gem for ruby.

Arden-PHP is under heavy development, and is a replacement for [Auto-Modeler](https://github.com/zombor/Auto-Modeler).

Contribution is welcome. Make sure you know about phpspec, BDD and all that jazz. When in doubt, ask about contributing.
